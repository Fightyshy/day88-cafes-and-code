# day88-cafes-and-code
A website listing cafes found in that are great places to do coding work in general. 
Done as part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 course, [link here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/practice/1251204#overview)

All components required, including a requirements.txt, and a modified cafes.db (as provided at assignment start) have been included. There is a secret key, but that's just a random set of string used for csrf, and the security risks of deploying the website "as is" to production are understood (CKEditor allowing/saving input as html and a key used for csrf prevention not-withstanding). This will never see production deployment anyway, it's just a portfolio project with a prompt from the course after all.
